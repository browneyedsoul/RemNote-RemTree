## Quick Start Guide

① Create a Rem hierarchy like this:

- Grand Parent 1 
    - Child 1
        - Grandchild 1
        - Grandchild 2
    - Child 2
        - Grandchild 3
        - Grandchild 4

② Tag the root of the hierarchy ("Grand Parent 1") with Slash command `/` or `//` → find `Tree` → return(Enter). You can also apply the keyboard shortcut for easy entry (DEF. `⌥`+`⇧`+`t`).

③ The `Tree` command is also used to toggle between different states: 
- `Tree,` which displays the tree with no border lines
- `Treec,` which displays the tree with border lines whole tree structure 
- `non-existing` state, which removes the tree related power-up tag altogether
