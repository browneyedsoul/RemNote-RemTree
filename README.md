## Quick Start Guide

① Create a Rem hierarchy like this:

- Grand Parent 1 
    - Child 1
        - Grandchild 1
        - Grandchild 2
    - Child 2
        - Grandchild 3
        - Grandchild 4

② Tag the root of the hierarchy ("Grand Parent 1") with Slash command `/` or `//` → find `Tree` → return(Enter). You can also apply the keyboard shortcut for easy entry (DEF. `⌥`+`⇧`+`t`).

③ The `Tree` command is also used to toggle between different states: 

|state|description|
|---|---|
| `Tree` | displays the tree with no border lines |
| `Treec` | displays border line around whole the tree structure |
| `non-existing` | removes the tree related power-up tag altogether |
